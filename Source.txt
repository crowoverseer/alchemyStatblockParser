Description
*"There was little we could do. Even Miklas's healing light couldn't staunch the blood welling from the wound torn by the giant's spear."*

***Masters of Forest Depths***. Tainted by evil, these giants guard well their dark forested homes. Their dark mottled skin blends easily into the dappled light of shadowy woods.

***Vicious Hunters***. The giants live in small clans, usually led by their strongest warrior. They wield great spears roughly carved from bloodwood trees that tear ragged wounds which even skilled healers have trouble mending.

***Ancient Bargains***. These giants pay reverence to dark, long-forgotten spirits. Their shamans the vine callers, make blood-filled promises to ancient entities, hoping to reclaim lands they believe were stolen from them.

***Cunning Giants.*** Though not as strong as their giant cousins, bloodwood giants are far more cunning. Experts at woodcraft, they can evade all but the most skilled trackers in their woodland homes.

***Chieftan***. Most chieftains earn the grudging respect of their tribe by being their greatest hunter. Vine callers often tutor promising youth they foresee becoming clan leaders.

### Salvage
The massive bloodwood spears used by these giants are too large to be effectively wielded by Medium or smaller creatures.

However, individuals proficient in carpenter's tools who succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Nature) check can reduce the size of the giant's spear to the equivalent of a pike (1d10 piercing damage) and which inflicts the bleeding condition if targets fail a DC 12 Constitution saving throw (see *Grim Hollow Campaign Guide*).

### Lore
**DC 10 Wisdom (Survival)**: Bloodwood giants are experts at hiding in their woodland homes.

**DC 15 Intelligence (Nature)**: The blood spears used by these giants cut cruel wounds that can resist healing magic.

**DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)**: The tribe's vine callers are shamans who make pacts with ancient forest spirits to summon blood-drinking vines that rejuvenate the caster.
