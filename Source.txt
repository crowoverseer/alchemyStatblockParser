Constrict. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: The creature is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, blinded, and the apparmarole can’t constrict another target. In addition, at the start of the target’s turns, the target takes 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage if the target is not charmed.
Puppeteer. A creature grappled by the apparmarole must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 8 hours. While charmed, a telepathic link with the apparmarole is established. The apparmarole can issue commands without an action, which the creature does its best to obey.[r]Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
