Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) poison damage, the target is grappled (escape DC 13), and until this grapple ends, the living toxin can’t attack another target.
Toxic Invasion. A creature grappled by the living toxin must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution save or it takes 6 (1d6 + 3) poison damage, and the living toxin invades the creature’s body. While in this host, the living toxin has total cover from effects that originate outside the host, the host is poisoned, and the host takes 10 (2d6 +3) poison damage at the start of each of the living toxin’s turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This effect also ends if the host dies or is subjected to any effect that ends the poisoned condition. When the effect ends, the toxin leaves the host, entering an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the host.
