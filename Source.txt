A creature remains under the aura’s effect until it leaves the area, dies, or when the Angel of Empyrean chooses a new aura effect. Only one effect may be active at a time:[r]• Judgement. Creatures who start their turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 25 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains a level of exhaustion as intensified feelings of guilt, doubt, remorse, and self-criticism overwhelm the affected creature.
