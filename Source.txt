Since Oryela was set free by Karathran, Iel has taken complete control of her body, obsessed with finding Natana's Urn and taking it to the glade where his own body sits entranced. He is less concerned with the body of the former Huldra, and will not hesitate to sacrifice it in battle — if he cannot get Oryela's hands on the Urn, she is of no use to him anyway.

Since Iel has already been thoroughly corrupted, he has nothing to lose from using the Spear of Terael-Kael (below) and the Cowl of Dorgvalg (page 190). Hence, the characters face an extremely wrinkled, shriveled old woman with bushy grey-black hair, dressed in a bright white cowl and leaning on an ornamented spear. A jet-black bat hovers nearby, actually Iel's fiendish familiar, Malek. Malek will likely attempt to deliver larvae boil for Iel to weaken an opponent.
