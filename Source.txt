About
*"Unnatural growths and limbs protrude from this creature, which might have once been a person but is now a monster."*

***Patchwork Body.*** Some people do anything for power. Those who become garish augments make deals with otherworldly powers or experiment with vile magic to enhance themselves. Such pursuits often go terribly wrong.

A garish augment might fight with an enormous claw, acid spit, quills, or all the above. None are identical. Every augment is different, and few who see one ever mistake another for it.

***Unquenchable Need.*** A garish augment never ceases its quest to kill and harvest appendages and organs from other creatures to incorporate into its own makeup.

***Fiendish or Aberrant Aid.*** The alchemical processes necessary to successfully augment doesn't come from magic alone. At some point, the garish augment delved into forbidden knowledge, either fiendish or aberrant in nature, to successfully bond parts of their victims to their living body.

### Salvage
With 1 hour of work and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check, the acidor poison-producing organ of a garish augment can be harvested to provide one vial of acid or two doses of basic poison.

However, unless fiendish pieces of the creature are burned, the fiend whom the garish augment dealt with might come seeking payment from the augment's killers.

### Lore
**DC 15 Intelligence (Religion or Arcana):** This creature's strange augmentations give it a variety of attacks and means of movement.
