Backstab (1/turn). Roia deals an extra 14 (4D6) damage when she hits a target with a melee weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of her ally who isn’t incapacitated and she doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
Blade Work. If Roia uses her bonus action to make an off-hand melee weapon attack, she adds her Dexterity modifier to the damage.
Cunning Action. On each of her turns, Roia can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
Evasion. If Roia is subjected to an effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, she instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

Roia was once the scout of the squad and has innumerous scars on body and face from being the first to discover (and at times, being discovered by) the enemy. Other than that, she is primarily known for her dark sense of humor.

When Serex has his famous outbursts it is not uncommon to hear the hoarse, croaking laughter of a woman over the sound of the turmoil; later the two friends often leave the scene together – the utterly drunk Serex leaning on Roia, who has been thrown out for making other guests uncomfortable with her gallows humor. The idiot who dares suggest that they are headed for a shared bed has only himself to blame for the pain.
