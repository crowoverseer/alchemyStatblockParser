Aberrant Wound. If a creature other than an undead or a construct takes damage from the shifting hulk’s attacks, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or lose 5 (2d4) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an aberrant wound. This damage is cumulative. A creature can take an action to staunch the wound, ending this effect with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
Vicious Critical. When the shifting hulk scores a critical hit with an attack, it can roll the attack’s damage dice three times instead of twice.
Fast Healing. While at half its hit points or fewer, the shifting hulk regains 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. This trait doesn’t function while the hulk has 0 hit points.
Shapechanger. The shifting hulk can use an action or a bonus action to polymorph into a form that resembles its Small or Medium humanoid appearance before it became a horror. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true Large form if it dies.

Multiattack. The shifting hulk makes two attacks and uses frightening attacks.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage and Aberrant Wound.
Spine. Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage and Aberrant Wound.
Frightening Attacks. Each creature of the shifting hulk’s choice within 30 feet of the hulk and aware of it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be- come frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hulk’s frightening attacks for the next 24 hours or until it scores a critical hit, whichever comes first.
Description
*“Children sing nursery rhymes about suspicious strangers for a reason. Heed the tales and check them for tentacles before offering shelter.”*

***Abominable Experiment.*** In desperate times science and magic can progress by leaps and bounds, but such rapid advancement has its risks. Without proper precautions, experimenters or their subjects might be caught in forces beyond imagining and become twisted into something abominable. No two mishaps are alike, yet each of the misbegotten results is known as an aberrant horror.

***Warped Flesh.*** Those who survive the uncontrolled transformation into aberrant horrors become living weapons. Some theories say the body sees the transmuting force as a threat and evolves defenses against it. Others believe that the accident triggers dormant bestial adaptations from the distant past. Whatever the reason, aberrant horrors are vicious combatants, armed with hardened claws, venomous spines, and other strange adaptations.

### Salvage
Aberrant horrors have been saturated in eldritch energies. Each horror’s body can provide a number of material components for arcane necromancy or transmutation spells equal to half the horror’s challenge challenge rating. Each component is consumed when used to cast, but the spell is cast as if the caster used a spell slot one level higher, up to a maximum of a 5th-level slot.

### Lore
**DC 10 Intelligence (History):** Aberrant horrors are the results of failed arcane experiments that twist the body into unnatural forms.
**DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):** Each aberrant horror is different. Some grow extra limbs, others dissolve into oozelike creatures, and others swell to massive proportions. They contain eldritch energy that can fuel necromancy and transmutation.


``` Title: GM Advice
The arcane origins of aberrant horrors give you a great deal of room to challenge your players with unusual traits. For example, one horror might only take damage when it’s under the effects of a bane or bless spell, but ferreting out this information requires the characters to face it once and succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The secret to pulling this off is to make the odd traits easy to learn and possible to accomplish without overly taxing the characters.
